The healthRecord class serves as a template for storing basic patient information, such as first name, last name, and unpaid bills, 
and declares several abstract methods for calculating age, checking if a patient is deceased, calculating unpaid bills, and displaying records.
The subclasses, medicalHistoryRecord and pathologyRecord, extend this base class by implementing these abstract methods and adding specific fields related 
to medical history (like birthplace, diagnosis, weight, and height) and pathology (like blood type, blood count, and any blood abnormalities).
Both subclasses override the abstract methods to provide functionality tailored to their specific medical context, such as calculating age, assessing a patient’s
health status, and determining the total unpaid balance, including any additional costs from medical procedures or medications. 
The classes also include methods to display detailed patient records, providing a comprehensive overview of a patient’s medical or pathology history.
